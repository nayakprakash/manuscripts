* Introduction:  
 This is an ambitious project after 2
 months.of struggle to get emacs org
 mode.working on win 7 and am not sure it
 is gonna
 work.
cite:Sutherland2003UNIVAC,Karthik2001Analysis,Taylor2003Influence
multiple citations cite:Sutherland2003UNIVAC

* Methods :  
To create a folder named research with subfolders named todo, done, papers and notes. The idea is to
1. have papers with all pdfs named by their bibtex keys
2. notes have tagged links to their respective pdfs and have properties with their bibtex keys as customized IDs
3. todo has ongoing work and finally
4. done has done work.
A new citation with notes.org link.I want to cite:fitzpatrick1998predicting
and also.

** Inserting Images:

Now I am going to add a pic and call it my image using latex attributes.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1cm :caption {my image} 
[[file:big_chick.png]]
 And now cite a
   reference.\cite{Brooks1997Methodology}Note that file link worked
   because the file was in the same foder as this document, that is
  the 'todo' folder. So hopefully if I have the .bib file in the same
   folder as well, things should work smoothly.Except it didn't
 because the org-latex-export-pdf group function wasn't set right. I
 changed the value to pdflatex,bibtex,pdflatex,pdflatex or set it to
 latexmk and both worked well.On an iteration though, latexmk did not
 do the job, but the prioe pdflatex bibtex combo did.  Lets try, so may be
   the notes should be in the same folder as well, which means i am
   going to have just one folder called todo which can have papers ,
   bib,notes and the manuscript I am working on .Once done with
   writing it I can move them to the done folder. cite:Karthik2001Analysis,
* Results : 
Now I am gonna try a second reference.\cite{Jacobson1999Towards}
Note that i did not have to type  to get the
references. All other basic Latex Markups or attributes work well. I love this. Victory at last!!
