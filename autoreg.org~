* Introduction 
The tracker registration process is the key stone step in image-guided surgery, but can
often be time consuming and frustrating while hampering workflow. When applied
to tumor surgery, anatomical points are often unavailable while surface
matching forces unnecessary exposure of 'normal' bone surface. This study
presents the development, testing and clinical validation of a novel "anatomy
agnostic" metal-free tool to achieve reliable and consistent automatic registration as validated with fiducial and target registration errors. The system leverages the availability of an intra-operative Cone-Beam CT (iCBCT) system in the OR (Zeego, Siemens Healthcare, Germany).
* Methods
Tools made of Ultem (amorphous thermoplastic polyetherimide (PEI)
resin) with known fixed geometry and attached reflective markers were designed.The 'auto-reg' tools were placed on the patient anatomy or on the operating table beside the patient ensuring that both the tumor and the tools were seen in the iCBCT imaging
field of view(Figure 1). The points corresponding to the auto-reg
tool geometry were then accurately identified on the CT image. The
3D spatial coordinates of the auto-reg tools and the tracker (dynamic
reference base fixed to patient anatomy) were also captured at the same instance by an
infrared camera (NDI Polaris,Waterloo,Canada)(Figure 2). Registration was then
easily achieved as image and tracker coordinates of the auto-reg tools
were known. This process involved no surgeon interaction and registration was
possible before the surgical incision.The registration was depicted and
validated and using fiducial and target registration error (FRE and TRE) maps.

* Results
To date this novel technique has been used clinically on 6 patients with
extremity tumors as a part of a larger study to validate a novel
navigation platform using iCBCT imaging. The ability to achieve registration prior to incision, without surgeon interaction to physically identify points, was
deemed a significant benefit to enable a seamless workflow when using iCBCT. It brought down the mean registration time to less than 2 mins once CT images were
captured (which took an average of ~7 mins).The absence of metal artifacts and ability to position the tools on or off the patient allowed freedom in obtaining desired optimal
fiducial configurations resulting in wide areas of target error less than
1 mm(mean 0.90 _+_ 0.24mm(standard deviation))(Figure 3). The mean FRE was
0.86mm.

* Conclusions
A novel method for automatic registration has been developed that is anatomy agnostic
and free of metal artifact to allow freedom for achieving optimal fiducial
configurations. This system made registration possible before surgical incision and
without surgeon interaction, and demonstrated consistent and
reliably low FRE and TRE in a clinical setting for extremity bone tumor
navigation using intra-operative cone beam CT imaging.
