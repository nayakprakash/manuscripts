* Abstract
* Rationale
To make osteotomy more accurate, decrease operative time and improve
workflow, and likely improve accuracy or feasibility of reconstruction
with metal augments, alografts or custom built
megaprosthesis.Evaluation of the indirect costs of the process beyond
the costs of the imaging and the manufacturing of the cutting guide.In
the knee arthroplasty literature the cost benefit analysis of the
novel procedure were based of its potential to reduce operating time
and allow time for additional cases and substantially reduce coronal
malalignment and reduce future health care costs by reducing the
number of potential future revisions.
