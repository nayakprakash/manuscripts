* Introduction
It is safe and acceptable to currette a benign or a low grade lesion
provided the recurrence rates are low and reconstruction is reliable
and lasting. The question then is when can I currette but not reliably
reconstruct ?  Should I then resect only because I cannot reconstruct
? There surely are lesions that I cannot currette, but are there
lesions I must not currette ?  The underlying assumption to this
question seems; because currettage usually 'preserves' that it must
provide more function than resection. When can resection be more
functional than currettage? By logic and exclusion one concludes that
lesions to resect are the ones
1. I cannot currette
2. I must not currette
3. I cannot biologically reconstruct.

An exploration of this premise should lead us to a reaonable answer.
